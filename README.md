## 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m passionate about using data to uncover insights, tell compelling stories, and solve meaningful problems. I enjoy reading trends, understanding the patterns behind the numbers, and making data-driven decisions that help teams and leaders take confident, strategic actions. I also have a strong interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence—working on predictive modeling and time series forecasting is something I’ve done and genuinely enjoy. These areas excite me because they combine analytical thinking with innovation, allowing me to turn complex data into smart, forward-looking solutions.

I love using data to tell stories, solve problems, and make things work better.
